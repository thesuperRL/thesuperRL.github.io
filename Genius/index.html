        Creating things in the EPS Makerspace

    <p>
        One of my favorite things to do is to make things in the EPS makerspace.
        I began in 9th grade working on small projects with 3D printing, and started by learning the two types of 3D printers here.
        Later, I transitioned to other materials, mostly after I entered the 10th grade.

            Now, I know how to use many of the makerspace machines. 
            These are the machines that I often use. (Click to expand)

        Lately, I have been increasing my skills with 3D modeling in order to create more impressive projects.
        I now mainly use Fusion 360, and I am working on modeling the organization of a car trunk for the EPS EV project.
        With this, we can adequately plan out the locations of the future electronics.
        I am also receiving the first requests for me to make something, starting from a "commission" of a wicket a few days ago.
        <br> <br>
        My goals with this skill is to create:
        <ul id="goalslist">
            <li> A "Layered Laser Cut" with pieces stacked on each other to create depth </li>
            <li> A functional 3D print that involves gears to have a purpose </li>
            <li> Proficiency with the Resin Printer </li>
            <li> Start a shop to sell some of the products I make </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
