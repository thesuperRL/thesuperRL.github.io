            Silvestria (Latin for "Woodland") is a small local, online store started by two high school friends in the end of their sophomore year. 
            <br>
            This is their first business together, and with Silvestria they hope to create a change in this stagnating world, one product at a time.

                    Hi, I'm Ryan! I'm interested in creating crafts around the EPS makerspace, and I love using my 3D modeling talent to solve problems and create neat decorations.
                    In Silvestria, I create the products in CAD and bring them into reality for customers. I also made this website!
                    I wanted to start this company with Nathan because it allows us to give back to the community, and provides experience for future businesses.

                    Hi, I'm Nathan! I'm interested in everything business and finance, and I love creative ideas. 
                    In Silvestria, I help create new products and help market them to potential customers. 
                    I also give ideas to Ryan to improve prototypes on products and work on the business aspect of the company. I helped brainstorm and implement the Bridge Bidding Box.
                    I wanted to start this company with Ryan because it seemed like a fun project that could work.

                    Masato Sudo-Sensei, Ryan and Nathan's web design teacher at EPS, for whom this website doubled as Ryan's Web Design Final.
                    When Ryan was starting to learn the makerspace tools, he offered a lot of advice and helped him learn how to work the machines.
                    Without his guidance and his class, this company wouldn't exist.

            What is Silvestria?
        </h1>
        <p>
            Silvestria is a company that Ryan and Nathan co-founded.
            Throughout Ryan's 9th grade year, he made many items, 3D printed, laser cut, or vinyl cut, giving them all to his friends and family.
            Many of his friends jokingly said "you should sell this!"
            <br><br>
            Little did they know, these lighthearted comments would give birth to a new idea - a company where Ryan can use his own skills to give back to his community.
            Ryan came up with the idea of the company during the initial months of his sophomore year, though he was too busy to implement it during most of his sophomore year.
            Towards the last few months, on a car ride to Nathan's house for work on finals, they created a wonderful vision of a new company - one that sells products Ryan makes in order to return the profits to the community.
            They initially called it "Woodland Warmth".
            <br><br>

    <div class="container-fluid text-white p-3 importantbox rounded-5 m-auto">
        <h1 class="p-3">
            What is EPS?
        </h1>
        <p>
            EPS, Eastside Preparatory School, is the school that both Ryan and Nathan go to.
            All of the Silvestria products are made with the resources and machines that EPS provides.
            Even the CAD software that Ryan uses, Autodesk Fusion 360, is thanks to the student access that EPS procured.
            That's why Silvestria donates half of its "profits" to the school, as thanks for materials and machines, 
            as well as giving back to the community which helped "create" Ryan and Nathan.
            This is the place where Ryan and Nathan first met, and where they created this company after almost two full years of friendship.

    <div class="container-fluid text-white p-3 importantbox rounded-5 m-auto">
        <h1 class="p-3">
            Why can we only preorder?
        </h1>
        <p>
            Because since Silvestria uses EPS materials and machines, we cannot make products outside of school. 
            That's why we keep a list of orders so that we can make them when school next starts, around the beginning of September.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="container-fluid text-white p-3 importantbox rounded-5 m-auto">
        <h1 class="p-3">
            Who can order?
        </h1>
        <p>
            So far, only members of the EPS community and their relatives, since Silvestria currently doesn't have the means to deliver yet (we're working on that, we promise).
