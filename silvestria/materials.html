            Vinyl Stickers
        </h1>

        <p>
            We make our stickers out of vinyl rolls, hand peeled and crafted by us.
        </p>

        <p>
            Use:
            <br>
            First, clean the surface. Wiping it with alcohol or a wet wipe (like a clorox wipe) can clean off all the dust. Wash it with water and wipe with a tissue or cloth if you want to clean it more.
            You should notice a clear film with blue grids on the sticker. That's the transfer film.
            Peel off the transfer film from the white paper. Make sure the entire sticker is on that film.
            If your sticker has small parts, just make sure to try and "push" the sticker onto the transfer film.
            Place the sticker and film on the surface you wish to adhere it to. Scrape it with something like your fingernails (or better yet, a credit card).
            Remove the film, making sure that this time it doesn't take the sticker with it. Voila!
        </p>

        <p>
            Maintenance:
            <br>
            The easiest to maintain out of all the materials. 
            Even the world "maintain" is a stretch. If there isn't significant force being exerted on it, it should be just fine.
            If there is a small vinyl piece on a sticker, it can be rubbed off as it doesn't have enough adhesive area, so just be careful of that
        </p>

        <p>
            Removal:
            <br>
            As for removal, just carefully peel it off (sometimes using a credit card to scrape it off can help).
            The sticker leaving behind some residue and a distinct color change is normal.
            This is the glue that holds the vinyl to the surface. The color distinction can be because dust didn't settle under the sticker but did outside the vinyl area.

            3D Print
        </h1>

        <p>
            We make our 3D prints out of biodegreadeable PLA, with the design being entirely made by us.
        </p>

        <p>
            Maintenance:
            <br>
            Maintenance for this is also very easy. Just make sure there isn't a very sudden force at a small area (for example, please don't stab it with a knife) and it shouldn't break.
            Depending on the item, there may be some differences in maintenance. Remember to read the details about the product. 
            Also, make sure to not place any very hot items (like a hot glue gun) beside it, or else it will melt where the glue gun touches it. 
            REMEMBER: 3D PRINTS ARE NOT WATERPROOF! They have tiny holes in the sides, and the center is hollow. 
            If you do get water into it, place it within the fridge overnight. The dehumidifier in the fridge will pull out the water slowly.
            <br>
            Or, try the old rice trick. It might work.

            Laser Cut Plywood
        </h1>

        <p>
            We make our laser cutting out of Plywood, with the design being entirely made by us.
        </p>

        <p>
            Maintenance:
            <br>
            Plywood is susceptable to water damages. Do not keep it wet, dry it off as soon as possible. Don't keep it in a humid environment.
            If the items require manual assembly, put it together lightly. If it feels like the piece is being forced, it will most likely break. 
            Consult the instructions.
        </p>

        <p>
            Disposal:
            <br>
            DO NOT BURN OR RECYCLE THE WOOD! THERE MIGHT BE SOME COATING TO MAKE SURE IT STANDS UP TO WEATHERING. Instead, simply recycle it.
        </p>
