    <p>
        The EPS makerspace has many tools to create things with. 
        There are many ways to utilize these tools: 3D printing, Laser cutting, Resin printing, and more.
        This page seeks to teach you about the tools required for them, primarily focusing on the easiest of the three: Laser Cutting.

    <p>
       Laser cutting is quite easy with the program Adobe Illustrator.
       Using it, you can take any image and trace it with the program, creating what is called a "vectorized" image.
       These vectors are essentially instructions that tell the machine how to move.
       With this, Adobe Illustrator essentially creates a file that tells the laser cutter the path to trace on the wood.

        The steps are easy: 
        <ol id="stepsList">
            <li>
                Find an image on the internet that you want to laser cut.
                Ideally, this image has at least one of the following characteristics:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Has only one color and the rest is white
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Has a white/light background with the silhouette as what is cut out
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Has clear divisions between colors (no fading in/out colors)
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Paste it into Adobe Illustrator, with the size of the canvas according to the specifications of the machine
            </li>
            <li>
                Go to Image Trace, then choose based on your specifications.
                Usually choose silhouette if you want to cut out the non-white region,
                choose black and white if you have a slight amount of edge fade, 
                and choose N-color trace if you want to cut out along the lines of different colors.
            </li>
            <li>
                Export to a PDF file, at EPS we drop it into the LasercuttingAndEtching online folder,
                at the Make@EPS folder within the online drive sharing.
            </li>
            <li>
                Find it from the laser cutter's computer, and use the machine to cut!
            </li>
        </ol>
    </p>
